                        When numbers and figures come together to form a proper analysis, it is called quantitative research. 
                        It is majorly used to find patterns and averages, make predictions, and generalize results to a wider population.
                         Quantitative research is widely used in understanding customer psychology and to get accurate marketing positioning.</span>

						<p id="o1">
                            This approach is used when you want to create social awareness or generate knowledge about the ongoing situation. Unlike qualitative research, there is no room for opinions or decisions derived through debates. 
                            Here, numbers, data, and graphs play a major role.
							<br><br>
							Using advanced tools and having subject matter experts on board, One Way Solution helps to give you a narrower result by giving comprehensive solutions to all the pain points.

						Here, analysis takes place to derive the current status of an identified variable. These research projects are designed to provide systematic information about a particular phenomenon. There are no assumptions involved in the beginning here, but it comes into the picture after collecting relevant data. The information is collected in a standardized manner and each unit is studied carefully to start the hypothesis of the project.</span>

						Now, this method is majorly used to understand human behaviour in various situations.
